# liri-node-app

This application is similar to the virtual assistants found on cell phones except it answers written queries, not spoken ones. This application was built by Mike Mooney in January of 2019. Javascript is the main programming language used for this application.

The program also uses APIs from BandsInTown, Spotify, and OMDB.

Examples of queries the program can respond to are 'concert-this', 'spotify-song-this', and 'movie-this'. These queries respond information on the musician, song, or movie asked about, respectively. 

The program functions on the command line and queries are types into the command line to get responses. It can be used on most modern computers with a command line program.
